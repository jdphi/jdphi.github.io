	<h1>Creating a Github Page to show off your work!</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>To make a github page, first navigate to <a href="https://pages.github.com" target=_blank>pages.github.com</a>. Here you will find some instructions and set up pieces to create your Github page.</li>
			<li>In another browser, head to github.com.</li>
<<<<<<< HEAD
			<li>Sign up or sign in with Github.</li>
			<li>Once logged in, click in the top right of the screen on the '+'.</li>
			<li>Click New Repository.</li>
			<img src="new-repository.jpg" alt="picture of clicking on New-Repository"/>
			<li>In the Repository Name field, enter in [your username].github.io. The bracketed entry here will be replaced with the username that you created for Github. This needs to be spelled verbatim.<br>
			Note that this image shows that the name is already taken, as I have already created one for myself. You will see a green bubble with text if it is a valid name.</li>
			<img src="name-repository.jpg" alt="picture of how to name the repository"/>
			<li>Also set this to Public. This will allow others to see your Github page, by making it accessible to the internet.</li>
			<li>Click Create Respository.</li>
			<img src="public.jpg" alt='settings'/>
			<li>Once in the Respository, Click 'Add File' and then 'Create new file'.</li>
			<img src='create-file.jpg'/>
			<li>This will bring you into a file editor. Once here, give your file the name of 'index.html'.</li>
			<img src='name-file.jpg'/>
			<li>In the body of the file, enter in the following HTML code: <br>
				<div style="color:green;">
				&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;<br>
				&lt;html&gt;<br>
				  &emsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
				    &emsp;&ensp;&lt;title&gt;My Github Page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
				  &emsp;&lt/head&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;Hello World!<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;img src="my_picture.jpg"/&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
				&lt;/html&gt;<br>
				</div>
			<li>Click Commit new file at the bottom of the screen. Optionally, you can enter in notes for the change just above the Commit button. It may be a good idea to include some brief note on what you are creating with this Commit.</li>

			<li>One finished, you may wish to upload a picture of yourself for your Github page. In which case, take a picture of yourself, put it in your computer, and name it to 'my_picture.jpg'.<br>
				It is named this so that it will match with the image source that was specified in the html code.</li>
			<li>In your [username].github.io repository, Click Add file, then Upload files.</li>
			<li>Upload that image of yourself that you worked on previously. When the upload is complete, click Commit Changes.</li>
			<li>Now visit 'https://[username].github.com' and view your Github page! This should display your "Hello World!" text, as well as a picture of yourself.</li>

		<h3>Troubleshooting steps</h3>
		<p>If you are having issues getting your Github page to display, try going into your Github repository that contains your files, and edit the README.md file that is within.<br>
		Give the README.md file some text and then commit changes to it. I had issues getting my Github repository to display until I completed this step.</p>
